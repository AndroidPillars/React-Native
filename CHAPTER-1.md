# React Native

- React Native is a framework that builds a hierarchy of UI components to build the JavaScript code.
- It has a set of components for both iOS and Android platforms to build a mobile application with native look and feel.

# React.js

- It is an open source JavaScript library to create user interfaces.
- Typically used for Web Development.
- ReactDOM.render(...) adds the web support.
- React itself is Platform agnostic.

# DOM

 - DOM stands for Document Object Model. 
 - It is the structure representation of all nodes in HTML document. 
 - DOM provides a way for JavaScript to interact with every single node in an HTML document to manipulate it.

# Why React Native

- With React Native Framework, you can render UI for both iOS and Android platforms.
- It is an open source framework, which could be compatible with other platforms like Windows or tvOS in the near future.
- React Native Development is comparatively simple, quick and efficient.
- React Native is a UI focused, which makes the apps load quickly and gives a smoother feel.
- Gaint Companies like Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Airbnb, Tesla, Walmart, Baidu Mobile and Bloomberg developed their apps using React Native Framework.

# How React Native Works

 React Native is a seperate library which in the end is a collection of special React components it gives you, so a collection of components you can use in your React app and these components are special because React Native actually knows how to translate them, how to compile these components to native widgets for ios and Android. So React Native kind of is like React DOM, it knows how to talk to native platform, to Android and iOS and how to render native widgets and it gives a bunch of these widgets as React components so that you can build a user interface with these compilable components(i.e)you won't be able to use your regular divs and h1 and paragraph tags in React Native because there are no equivalents for that in Native Code. But beside giving you this components, React Native is a bit more than that, it also gives access to some native platform APIs, For example it helps us to use the device camera, common tasks you would want to do in Native Apps and in general React Native gives you to tools to connect javascript code to native platform code because you typically build a React Native app by mostly writting Javascript code or depending on the app you're building, by entirely writing Javascript. Now I say mostly, atleast that's a possibility because you can also write native code for iOS and Android and React Native gives you the tools to connect your Javascript code to that native code, though that's a bit more advanced and in many apps,You will never need that and therefore, React Native gives you full flexibility, it gives you a way of connecting Javascript to native code and it also gives you a lot of pre-built native features which are conveniently usable from inside your Javascript code. So if you then 
combine React Native and the features that gives you with React.js which knows how to update a user interface and how to control user 
interface, then you get everything you need to compile a real native mobile app and that's also what React Native gives you, it gives 
you everything you need to then take a Javascript code and compile that to a real native mobile app which you can ship to the App Store
for iOS and Google Play for Android. So you get a real native mobile app as a result at the end.

__In Simple Terms,__
- A collection of "special" React components.
- Components compiled to Native Widgets.
- Native Platform APIs exposed to JavaScript.
- Connects Javascript and Native Platform Code.
- React.js + React Native = React Native Mobile Apps.

# Behind the Scenes

- The JavaScript is the language we use to build React Native Apps.
- Here, Components are compiled to real native widgets, to real native elements, to real native code.
- JavaScript code where you manage your business logic will not be compiled. but, your views will be and that of course also means that 
you typically get a great performance when building React Native Apps.

# Expo vs React Native CLI

- For Creating React Native app -> Two Options -> Expo CLI and React Native CLI.
